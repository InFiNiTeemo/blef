Hi, I have another question. Does the data with CC BY-NC-ND license allowed in the competition?

I am reading the following url and according url1, in terms of training AI, data access to the copyright works was lawful at the point of input. Thus according to the graph in url2, the CC license is not triggered.

https://creativecommons.org/2021/03/04/should-cc-licensed-content-be-used-to-train-ai-it-depends/#fn2
https://creativecommons.org/faq/#artificial-intelligence-and-cc-licenses
To summarize, it seems that the data with CC BY-NC-ND is allowed to train AI, but I would like to have a double check to keep myself follow the competition rule.
